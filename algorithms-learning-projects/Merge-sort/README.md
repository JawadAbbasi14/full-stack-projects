Merge Sort Visualization with Matplotlib
Welcome, coders! 🚀 This Merge Sort Visualization project is a Python script that implements the Merge Sort algorithm and visualizes each step using Matplotlib. It shows how the array splits, merges, and sorts with neat bar plots. Perfect for learning algorithms, debugging, or showcasing in your portfolio—especially if you're working on a fullstack project like mjstore or aiming to impress clients as a freelancer.
🧠 What’s This Project About?

What it does: Implements Merge Sort and visualizes the process step-by-step with bar charts, highlighting splits, merges, and element placements.
Why it’s useful:
Learning: Visualizing Merge Sort makes its divide-and-conquer logic super clear.
Freelancing: Great for building educational tools, dashboards, or algorithm demos for clients.
mjstore: Can be adapted for sorting product data (e.g., by price or ID) in your fullstack project’s backend or admin dashboard.



🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed.
Matplotlib: Install it with:pip install matplotlib



How to Run

Clone or download this repository:git clone https://github.com/JawadAbbasi14/full-stack-projects.git


Navigate to the project folder:cd full-stack-projects/algorithms-learning-projects/MergeSort


Run the script:python merge_sort_with_plot.py


Watch the visualization! The script will display bar plots for three example arrays, showing the sorting process step-by-step.

File Structure

merge_sort_with_plot.py: The main Python script with the Merge Sort algorithm and Matplotlib visualization.

🎯 Real-World Use Cases

Learning Algorithms: Understand Merge Sort’s O(n log n) time complexity with visual feedback.
mjstore Project: Use Merge Sort to efficiently sort product lists (e.g., by price, ID, or category) in your Django/PostgreSQL backend for faster search or display.
Freelancing: Build interactive algorithm demos or educational tools for clients in EdTech or tech training.

📊 Why Bar Plots?

Why plt.bar?: Bar plots clearly show array values at each index, making it easy to track changes during splits and merges.
Connection to Logic: The orange highlights in the plot show which elements are being processed, tying directly to the algorithm’s divide-and-conquer steps.

🛠️ Customization Tips

Change the unsorted_array in the script to test different inputs.
Adjust plt.pause() timings to speed up or slow down the visualization.
Add to mjstore by integrating this logic into a Django view to visualize product sorting in your admin dashboard.

📈 Next Steps (Roadmap)

Try visualizing other sorting algorithms (e.g., QuickSort, Bubble Sort) to compare performance.
Integrate with mjstore’s API to sort and display data dynamically.
Use Chart.js for a web-based version to showcase in your portfolio.

Happy coding, and let’s keep building that mjstore empire! 😎
